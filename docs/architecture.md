# Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The User Onboarding and Approval Platform is designed to facilitate secure user registration and management. The architecture is built to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security, adhering to modern software development practices.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend
- **Technology**: ReactJS
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User registration and login through `RegisterForm` and `LoginForm` components.
  - Displaying user-specific information in the `UserDashboard`.
  - Admin functionalities in the `AdminDashboard`, including viewing and managing pending users.

### 2. Backend
- **Technology**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handling API requests for user registration, login, and approval processes.
  - Validating user input and hashing passwords for security.
  - Managing user states (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED) and persisting user data in the database.

### 3. Database
- **Technology**: Azure SQL Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Storing user information and states.
  - Supporting migrations for schema changes.

### 4. Containerization
- **Technology**: Docker
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Containerizing both frontend and backend applications for consistent deployment.
  - Using Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container applications.

### 5. Deployment
- **Technology**: Kubernetes
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Managing application deployment and scaling through Kubernetes configurations.
  - Using Helm charts for easier management of Kubernetes applications.

### 6. Security
- **Practices**:
  - Externalizing secrets through environment variables to avoid hardcoded credentials.
  - Implementing middleware for authentication and authorization.

## Workflow
1. **User Registration**: Users self-register through the frontend, which sends a request to the backend.
2. **Pending State**: New users are placed in a PENDING state until an admin approves or rejects them.
3. **Admin Approval**: Admins can view pending users and approve or reject them through the admin interface.
4. **User Notification**: Users are notified of their approval status through the user dashboard.

## Scalability
- The backend is designed to be stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling.
- Queue decoupling is implemented for processing user approvals, ensuring that the system can handle increased loads efficiently.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a robust framework for building a secure and scalable User Onboarding and Approval Platform, ensuring a smooth user experience while maintaining high standards of security and performance.
